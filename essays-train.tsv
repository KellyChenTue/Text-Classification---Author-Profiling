f	"I always wanted to work with words or language, and it didn’t matter for me would it be something related to neurolinguistics, 
just a simple translation work or anything more computational. 
In the end I got a bit more interested in computer linguistics, because in school I always was good with programming and it felt 
natural to continue improving myself in that field. 
Also computational linguistics would allow me to solve bigger variety of tasks: 
it’s really impressive how studying one thing can help you to “get access” to so many completely different fields 
starting from speech recognition to machine translation. 
Another linguistic field which I find quite exciting is contrastive linguistics, I mean, 
it is very interesting to compare morphology, syntax, pragmatics etc of two or more different languages. 
I guess they main reason why both computational and contrastive linguistics are appealing to me is 
because they both are very practical-oriented, which I always prefer to plain theory."
f	"Ever since I was a little kid, I was interested in different features of language. When I learned to write I wondered why words are often written so differently from how they are spoken.
Whenever I learned a different language or met someone foreign, I was interested in special peculiarities of the language like idioms or slang. Later my dad introduced me to programming and I was fascinated by the fact
that you can tell your computer exactly what to do using a special language. When I had to decide on a field of study I remembered these two interests of mine, decided to put them together and study ISCL in Tübingen.
I am especially interested in intelligent language and voice systems, chat robots, language related research using computational methods, and machine learning for e.g. sentiment analysis or authorship attribution. I believe that these NLP technologies
can improve our lives in vastly different ways, be it data mining to analyse opinions on social media or improving online translation services like Google Translator to help people around the world communicate with each other."
f	"I study Computer Science and Mathematics, which has introduced me to formal
languages and complexity theory.  Since I was a kid, I've been interested in
learning languages and intrigued, more broadly, by how language functions.
Because of  this, combined with my background in Math and CS, I found myself
interested in linguistics, especially in regards to trying to codify and parse
language.  Last summer I started working in a lab doing audio analysis
research.  This inspired me to learn more about Natural Language Processing,
especially in relation to Machine Learning.  As such, I find that my interest
in the fields of linguistics and computation largely surrounds the question of
""how can we use computation and/or computational models to better understand
natural languages?"", both in practical and theoretical ways."
m	﻿I'm interested in different parts of linguistics and computation. Combining different parts of linguistics, like syntax and phonology of a language, with computation, such as parsers, is a very interesting field of Computational linguistics. In my opinion, Machine Learning systems are one of the main point of our future. A machine being able to learn from own mistakes and improve the overall system is a very helpful tool that we already use on a day to day basis. One of the main points of Machine Learning, are neural-networks, which I believe are the future of how we use our technology and software. Combining Machine Learning with real languages and analyzing those is in my opinion one of the most interesting topics in Computational Linguistics.
f	As a student in ISCL in Tuebingen, I have to say that it’s a good place to study. In our country, we have different dialects in different areas. And I realized that I actually like to mimic those sounds from dialects. Or saying that, I am speaking one of the dialects but I didn’t realize it until my friends told me. I’d like to see how a language influences our culture and the way we live, or the other way around. Another reason how I found my interest in Linguistics is just from some kids. I like to play around with children and observe how they develop their language skills gradually, it’s amazing to watch a child learning to speak and think, isn’t it? I always try to solve problems in a logical way, that’s why computation field would fit in my plan. And it’s really much fun to learn computational skills and make it useful to our life!
m	"Language has always fascinated me. Be it the word games or stupid, little creations.
The ever evolving tool for human communication is so incredibly complex that noone really understands it.
But we can try! That is what fascinates me. On one hand using language in everyday life and on the other hand trying to analyze it and make it machine digestible.
Today the interface between human and machine consists mostly of buttons and other touch based input methods.
For me a big motivation is the idea that one day communication between human and machine is mostly natural language based. That is what I want to help make reality."
m	I first started studying computational linguistics as a minor, mainly for the programming part. Since then I discovered my interest for linguistics, especially how we actually learn a language. However, my main focus still lies at the programming part. I see a big future for machine learning and neural networks in the linguistic field. We'll see a whole bunch of new and interesting technologies emerges in the next couple years, which will make heavy use of stuff we currently learn. Not only the technical aspects, but also the moral ones are interesting for me. Because our speech is a highly personalized characteristic of ourselves, it's important that we know how our data is used throughout the internet and the applications we're using everyday. In order that we can still speak freely whats on our mind.
m	I am interested in linguistics and computation because it can easily find a job. I am not saying that other major is hard, but anything related to computer is good to find one. Furthermore, if you were in the class where they taught you computer skills, you can naturally bring your laptop and read news or go shopping without any problems. You can do this in other classes as well, but doing it in programming class is more natural. BTW, machine learning is sooooo cool that my mom is proud of me :-P.
f	I chose to study Computational Linguistics because it combines computer science and linguistics. I have not done much programming before, but since I started studying ISCL I find it very interesting. I enjoy solving tricky tasks and coming up with new solutions to programming problems. Moreover, I have always enjoyed learning new languages but I am also very interested in analysing them in a scientific way. As computational linguistics is at the intersection of these two areas, it provides many interesting research fields and I hope to be able to work on some of these in the future.
m	﻿Communication is essential for learning, or respectivly teaching. I'm very interested in artifical intelligence, especially ones that are capable of learning. Now to teach a computer one would have to be able to communicate with it in a way. Destroying the blockade between language, text or speech, or any input in general, and the computer would make it possible to let a AI learn existing sources without further help. Imagine for example an interactive AI with the entire knowlegde of Wikipedia or even every published paper. Surely there's more to do than just tell a computer how to read, but it's still a start.
f	My interest in linguistics started with my desire to better comprehend the English language. From a very early age I developed fast a great interest in languages. Though the thought of engaging in the field of computational linguistics has never crossed my mind until I found this program in Tuebingen that combines both my love for languages and the current necessities of computation of almost everything. I am fascinated by the ongoing developments in the field and I’ve always been curious to learn what happens behind the curtains. With the help of this field our everyday lives are constantly improved. At first the idea of replacing more and more of our services with technology , frightened me but come to think of it, our lives are considerably improved by artificial intelligence. With the help of it we can pursue any goal we want, be it a career, family or just travelling. Robots could change the world into a better place, they could serve us or be our friends, or execute our time consuming and repetitive tasks. They could create enough resource and revenue to sustain our choices and preferences of living where for example, things like “I need a job in order to sustain a living!“ would no longer exist. In conclusion, these are some of the reasons why my interest in computational linguistics is constantly developing.
m	"I like the idea of improving the relationship between computers and regular language through the study of Computational Linguistics, which can be achieved by creating software products that have some knowledge of human language.
Such products are going to change our lives, they are urgently needed for improving human-machine interaction since the main obstacle in the interaction between human and computer is a communication problem.
Such computer programs will also make a broad set of interesting natural language applications possible: spoken information systems, machine translation systems, natural language interfaces, and many others.
Studying Computational Linguistics enables me to have a better understanding of how both human and machine languages works and how to be able to make that connection between them.
Another motivation to study computational linguistics is the theoretical part of it, since it focuses on the computation of the relation between form and meaning for its own sake. This computation has interesting formal properties and relates in interesting ways to theoretical aspects of the theory of computing in general."
m	I am a master student of English linguistics, and my main motivation in studying linguistics is to study languages from a more scientific perspective. As I started my study program in Tuebingen university, I got interested in computational and quantitative approaches to the study of language, therefore I am taking more computational and statistical courses. What I am particularly interested in is formal and statistical semantics, computational semantics, and natural language processing in general.
m	Sound always fascinates me. It surrounds us in our whole life, yet for most of us we can't see it. In the form of languages, it carries information and emotion among us. In the form of music, it covers the boredom in the air. These frequencies of vibration somehow shaped who we are. With a background of music and engineering, I came here to further delve into the computational world. I wish to crack the hidden secret of sound, music and speech, creating innovative technologies to bring new insights to ourselves. There is one more thing. I speak a rather ancient language that can be traced back to about 2000 years ago. But it is dying, being murdered politically. I want to shelter it via technology and spread it through the net. So when the last word meets its end, the seed of the language   could rise again.
f	My interests in language are mainly theoretical. While I like the practical side of computational linguistics, I didn't chose to study it to create useful applications, but rather to learn more about different ways to formalise linguistics structures and meaning. I'm rather interested in computation only as a tool to solve problems. I enjoy different topics in formal semantics and learning about their occasional connections to philosophical ideas. However, right now I'm trying to collect some more knowledge on distributional semantics and linear algebra and I would eventually like to find a project for my thesis in this topic.
f	"﻿I think computational linguistics provides a lot of exciting concepts and projects. 
I'm currently interested in intelligent tutoring systems not only because a student can benefit from a learning environment that matches their skills and weaknesses but also because it can bridge the gap between (financially) advantaged and disadvantaged students.
Another topic I find intriguing is how language and statistics interact. A lot of recent research suggests that the way humans learn languages is connected to probability, and so are pretty much all state-of-the-art NLP tools, which use machine learning. 
Finally, computational linguistics plays a huge part in the development of intelligent systems (ai), which un-doubtedly is one of the most interesting things happening in the field of computer science."
m	"I started programming in the year 2000 with Basic and C and started founding startups in 2004, where we developed a social network for >1M users. My first encounter with NLP was when I studied search queries, entered by users to find other users, groups or general things in blogs and so on. Many queries had the format ""user city age"" - ASL! - so that a rule based system and a ngram index was quite sufficient. After that I developed a web analytics platform for two years, where my personal interest was lying on a sophisticated google-search referer clustering. At the end, it was a simple naive bayes implemented in SQL. Then I realized I need a more formal background in math and went to university, but started another ""toy startup"" in the first semester, where I break apart email addresses for semantic evaluation. The engine improves itself by seeing firstname/lastname combinations from news articles and Wikipedia and learning ngram combinations (since name.firstname, namefirstname, firstname.name, firstamename and so on are possible). That also brought me to sentiment analysis on news articles about politics in public media. In times where social media dominates what is worth spreading, its hard to say what is fake news and how media influences public opinion. 

My major is computer science and theoretical computer science brought me to the formalism behind languages. I developed a statistical/machine learning/other buzzwords approach to learn Type 3 languages from examples, like automatically translating CSV to HTML by examples. Another private research project is finding a temporal hierarchy in languages by clustering dictionaries, where I'm still on the hunt for dictionary sources. 

As human language is full of knowledge, it's fun to discover these treasures. That's why I'm really looking forward to the course to learn new techniques."
f	"I interested in N-gram and pos tagging. 
I already did in Java class, but i want to know how different way i can do with python.
And i specially interested statistical parsing. 
I learned statistic and parsing last semester, but both were more theory part. 
so i wonder what and how i can statistical parsing in NLP."
m	"During high school, I developed a high overall interest in learning foreign languages,
that included English, French, and some Latin (knowledge in the latter is long gone now). After I started my Bachelors' Degree in Medical Informatics, unfortunately, my focus had to be shifted and I didn't have the possibility of a minor degree.
I'm a Master student of Computer Science now, my aim is to combine the knowledge I gained in my studies with CL approaches, something I haven't done yet. I still have to figure out which courses are eligible for a minor in CL. Depending on the descision of my board of examiners, I may or may not continue with this course."
m	"Language is cool. Computers are too.
I always found language to be fascinating and have had an interest in
the underlying structures that make speech and writing work the way they do.
Using computers to facilitate the study of language seems obvious.
Being able to make a living with both seems great."
m	"My interests in computational linguistics are first of all to write programs.
I like the fact, that everybody is using computational linguistics in their life, but only a few know what it is.
It is very interesting how we can decompose our human language, so that our machines can work with them.
For example we can write parse algorithms and use NLP-tools to analyse a large corpus, which can save us a lot of work, but also it is always
necessary to have a human who checks the work done by a program and debug it.
For me the most challenging thing is, how I can write a program that is fast and efficient and uses all resources that a machine can give it."
m	"I used to study linguistics in the US. When studying there, i found semantics especially implicature very interesting. And it interests me that humans sometimes have trouble drawing the implicaturs when talking with each other, what 
about machines? Therefore, i want to see how we can come up with some algorithms for machines to capture implicatures. And this would significantly improve the accuracy of many voice assitants, such as Siri. More than that, i really want 
to know lots of new-fashioned, state-of-the-art techniques used in the field of AI."
m	"I am a ISCL, BA student. My interest in linguistics is Phonetics and Phonology as well as Syntax, Semantics
and Pragmatics and Language and Cognition. Also, my interest in Computational is Natural Language Processing and Underestanding,
Speech Recognition and Processing. I am also very interested in using new approchaces like, deep learning, Neural Networks and
Machine Learning to do the NLP and Speech recognition. Furthormore, I have passion to learn how can I use these AI algorithms to
interact with machines like Smart phones, Game box (like Xbox), Cars and so on."
f	﻿From the ISCL BA program, my main focus of interest is computer programming itself. From linguistics, I am mostly interested in cognitive linguistics and language use. I hope to learn how to use Python and Java for solving complex problems. I am also interested in looking at linguistic tasks as programming challenges. I am looking forward to this course as I hope it will help me become a better programmer.
f	Prior to 2016, when I commenced the BA in Computational Linguistics I did not have any interest in either Linguistics or Computation. A friend of mine was begining the ISCL degree in the winter and asked me to come with her. I said I had no interest in the degree however after some persuasion and as my job was very boring I said I would try it for a semester. I didn't really have any expectations of the course, nor did I have a clue what computational linguistics even meant, however I finsihed the 1st semester, then the second and third. I can now say that I definately have an interest in both the computational and linguistic side. I am very interested in machine translation (statistical and rule based). I find the programming side of things difficult and frustrating, but also very satisfying and somewhat enjoyable.
m	My interest in computation linguistics is the programming aspect of it.
f	I am a aster student in Computational Linguistics. I am really interested in the computational aspects of linguistics since it relates verw well to my bachelor background in computer software engineering. It will allow me to delve more into the links ebtween these two realms of science.
m	﻿I'm interested in the engineering side of computational linguistics. I like solving, in this case, interesting linguistic-based problems, and computers are good to such ends. Specifically, I'm intrigued by machine translation, dialog systems, text, classification, text mining/analytics, sentiment analysis.Therein lies my interest in linguistics and computation. And that's five sentences.
m	Growing up in a multilingual family with parents who traveled for work, I always had an interest in foreign languages. My parents would regularly switch between four languages, so learning them was expected of me as well. But I didn't mind, because I saw them as a puzzle and enjoyed fitting all the pieces together. Finally figuring out the right word to use, and placing it into its proper position in a sentence was satisfying, but I also knew it was a practical life skill and would allow me to travel and communicate with many more people than my monolingual peers. Around the same time I was beginning to understand my appreciation for natural languages, I was also discovering how to use a computer. Being a digital native, I've always been curious about how to hook up my Nintendo64 and customize my MySpace profile with HTML and CSS. So when machine translation services like Google Translate and foreign language education apps like Duolingo appeared, I realized I could leverage my passion for natural languages and technology into a career.
m	At high school I took some language classes, and for a long time linguistics was talked about, and something I was very curious about. I also did a lot of maths at high school, and had an interest in computer science. The combination of both linguistics and programming in one degree looked like a great opportunity. I enjoy the logic that can be applied to many aspects of linguistics. I additionally feel a great sense of satisfaction when I successfully solve a problem. I particularly like the fact that there are often multiple ways of approaching the same problem and that all of them can successfully solve the task at hand.
f	"Language is our main means of expressing ourselves. It helps to communicate, to express cultural identity in the sense of nationality but also in a more arty way. I have always been fascinated by that and how language / a dialect can change rapidly even from one village to the next. To ""teach"" a computer language in a world which is hardly imaginable without computers anymore, is a really interesting task. And in some sense, learning a programming language is like learning a new language to me."
f	"I'm interested in second language acquisition. Since I'm in the process of acquiring second and third languages which are English and German.
I'm also interested in lexical level of linguisics. Especially back-tracking the origin of words and fining their meanings. The Study of how the languages relate one to another is also interesting.
But I think I'm more interested in computation than linguistics.
I want to learn about deep learning and machine learning. I also want to learn how to extract informations from data and make use of them."
f	Regarding overall linguistics I was always very interested in languages, especially the similarities and differences between them. I also find it very interesting how languages change over time, what is the origin of a word and so on. Regarding Computational Linguistics my main interest are the different aspects to help people learn languages and work with them. This includes software to help learn languages, for example, implementing Second Language Acquisition theories to improve language learning applications. Another help for learning languages, what I am also interested in is machine translation.
f	What I find the most interesting about linguistics, is probably the fact that it is such a complex topic with so much to learn about. Even though we use it daily, there are such deep and interesting structures in natural language that we don't even think about or notice when speaking. Also the possibilities for research and applications in all the different fields of linguistics are pretty much endless. In a lot of those, computation can be a great tool, for example to help finding certain structures in a language. I find it especially fascinating, when such tools are used to create something really practical and helpful, for example a computer-based way to help children learn a foreign language efficiently. I also really like programming. Trying to pinpoint a concrete problem and then finding a solution for it, is just really fun to me.
m	"I am studying computer science and my favorite part of this study program is the
development of compilers and therefore also programming languages. If one is
concerned with studying and designing programming languages, it will become
quite obvious that language shapes thought in the most interesting ways. That is
why I also care much about natural languages and also how to formalize, analyze
and compute them."
f	I am currently interested in word embedding and compositionality. I am also interested in Math. I believe if I want ever make it in this field one day I should learn more Math, especially considering that I want to do more algorithms research. I am now also playing with Go and Rust. Those are pretty cool and powerful languages.
f	"My interest in linguistics started in high school, when I realised I was enjoying studying the grammar of my native language (Italian) and of the foreign languages which were taught at my school (Spanish and English).
After I graduated, I decided to attend a BA in Linguistic and Intercultural Mediation, which included an intense study of two foreign languages (German and English) and their linguistics.
Once I finished my BA, I got interested in the computational aspect of linguistics because of a radio podcast I once heard while I was at home. 
I started reading books about computational linguistics and I got more and more interested in it, until I decided to apply for the ISCL MA here in Tuebingen.
I think it is incredibly important to support research in this field, since it is highly innovative and useful for society."
f	My main interest lies in historical linguistics and investigating language change. I am particularly interested in the Amazigh (Berber) languages and Arabic although I don't speak any Berber nor Arabic dialect. I am not familiar with computation but I found it a practical aid to what I am interested in. I'd love to learn more about computation and programming so that I can investigate the topic I am interested in with more ease.I also find machine learning an intriguing field but I need to improve my sense of statistics.
f	At first I was only interested in Linguistics, in words, wording, which words people chose to communicate certain things, the way context can change a sentences' whole meaning, and also in the way words can be misunderstood. Then I started being interested in how languages and computers can be connected other than the fact that programming languages themselves are language, have grammar, carry meaning. How computers can be used to interpret meaning of a sentence also leads back to the question how humans process sentences. I like the interdisciplinarity of Computational Linguistics. One thing that fascinates me is how easy the use of computational language processing tools makes it to search a text for certain things, to alter things, and to process data very fast. Also how translation tools make communication easier, sometimes even possible, all over the world. ü
f	Within linguistics, I am mostly interested in formal semantics, primarily in old-school logical theories and rule-based implementations of syntax and semantics. For my master thesis, I am currently looking for a suitable topic involving either quantifiers, intensionality or causality. However, I am not really into natural languages as such but am mostly intrigued by the theories behind the formalisms themselves and, more dominantly, problems in mathematics/logic (in particular proof theory). Since I regret not having studied computer science or mathematics instead of linguistics but enjoy programming (and need to make a living at some point in the future), I am currently striving to broaden my foundations in statistical methods and computational linguistics. My hope is to get a good enough idea of modern NLP techniques such as machine learning and neural networks to be able to work into more advanced topics by myself, and to improve my programming skills in a way that is relevant for demands in the industry.
f	I chose to study computational linguistics, because this field of study includes both: technical and humanitarian subjects. Linguistics belongs to humanitarian field and computation-to technical field. At first I started my studies only in linguistics. It was amazing to acquire new knowledge about language structure and to learn how the language is build on its different levels. But when I decided to study language from a computational perspective it gave me even more insight into processes that occur within the language. The most exciting thing for me is the possibility of building models that can help machines process and generate the natural language. It seems to be of a great significance for the development of artificial intelligence that I consider to be very important goal for today's world.
m	"I came to this area somewhat serendipitously. In short, I had observed in the workplace what it was to be a programmer, I wanted to learn these skills, and this Computational Linguistics course proved was the best fit for me that was taught in English.
Since living in Germany I have come to greatly appreciate google translate, and I now use amazon alexa regularly. I am very excited about the potential of speech-based interfaces to provide a healthier way for humans to work with computers for everyday tasks (as opposed to the addictive and distracting interfaces that screens have become). 
It is also fun to consider the new ways that technologies could influence life through a speech interface, from telling the driver what the tyre pressure to streamlining agricultural practices by allowing farmers to record vocal data while their hands are dirty."
f	"Although I've always been passionate about learning languages, it is only recently that I've realized that languages are not some intangible entities. Before entering the program at the University of Tuebingen, I was convinced that languages and language learning could not be understood, structured or explained. I attribute this primarily to the fact that langugage learning has been more of a fun and easy experience for me rather than one that requires a lot of hard work, memorization and structure and pattern finding. 

 Although I am more keen on the linguistics part of CL, I do believe that the computational part is nonetheless important, mainly because it gives us the chance to look at language from a perspective that was not deemed suitable in traditional linguistics. In addition, I think that computational methods make the study of linguistics more efficient, as they allow analyses of huge amounts of data that were inconceivable just a few decades ago."
f	I am very interested in major computational linguistic fields such as speech recognition and machine translation. My favourite linguistic area is pragmatics. In my opinion it is a crucial and yet often ignored aspect in voice recognition and implementing chatbots. Therefore more work can be done in order to improve them. Another thing I would love to do something about is implementing cognitive processes underlying human speech (which can surely improve the quality of human to machine interaction).
m	"The biggest reason I took this course of study (not this  class specifically, but ISCL in general) was because I wanted to live in Germany.
The second biggest consideration for me was marketability; I already have a German degree (and was going for a degree in Biology in America 
before I ran out of money), but at this point I'm concerned primarily with the ability to get a well paying job, and my ability to obtain a work
visa in Germany. This class in particular seems to be extremely useful for making me competitive in the job market. I figured, with my 
background (and interest) in studying German, computational linguistics specifically seemed to be the most natural next step. Many of my 
friends back home in the USA have jobs in tech and, in their mid 20s, earn more than my parents, so it seemed logical to do the same as they 
did and put my layman's interest in computers and technology to use professionally."

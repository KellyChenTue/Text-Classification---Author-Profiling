f	My interest in languages and computer goes back to 2011, when I presented a Bachelor's thesis on the localization of food labels in order to fulfill my Bachelor's program in Translation (EN-PT) from the University of Brasilia (Brazil). For the purposed of my research, I got acquainted with the technological process involved in translating websites, apps, and softwares, which sparkled my interest in exploring the relationship between language and technology. As a result, I started a MA at the abovementioned University to explore localization development in Brazil by measuring the activity in platforms like Twitter - whereby I ultimately came across Computational Linguistic studies. Therefore, I’m interested in the impact caused by the growing development of tech gadgets aligned with language.
m	My main interest in linguistics and computation is from the time I spend working for the  homepage quality control department of a big automotive company. Back then we just started to do testing with automation. For example, Spell-checking had to be done in many languages. Doing this by visual checks (bot takes screenshots of pages and compares to stock images) for the corporate main pages was okay because the translations there were given (layout everything was already in image form provided in documentation, but the lower it went in the structure(from main country page to dealers etc.) the more freedom was there to make up own texts. To explain the homepages were created by the companies CMS system, so support for that was also with the quality control department. Having knowledge in linguistics and computation would have been a huge help back then for me. Also i understood after working on creating fully automated quality tests that this part of the job will only get bigger in size compared to manual testing.
m	I've been interested in computation for as long as I can remember. My parents bought a computer for our family when I was rather young, so I had a pretty unique experience as a kid in the area where I'm from, in the sense that I grew up with a computer and with the internet while some of my classmates didn't have a computer until much later. I basically lived in front of my computer in school and I was writing simple programs in Visual Basic and C# years before deciding to come to Tübingen, but I never really got deeper into the programming aspect before starting the ISCL program. Languages have also been a particular interest of mine, having grown up in an area where a couple languages are spoken and having moved around to a few different countries and learning the  local languages to some degree. Learning how the languages work seemed to make it easier to actually use the languages, which kind of lead to casual research on linguistics becoming a sort of hobby of mine.
f	Language is such a vital part of communication. Studying linguistics allows one to enjoy and learn the facets of such a science. The computational aspects allow one to further this knowledge and bridge the gap between these two disciplines. This course seems like it will finally give instruction in the practical application of computational linguistics, which I'm sure most are rather excited about. So yeah.
f	I am currently enrolled in the second semester of the MA program in Computational Linguistics.  In my undergraduate studies, I completed a BA degree in Linguistics and Psychology.  Prior to this program, I didn’t have any programming experience, but I am trying my best to catch up and improve my skills.  I really enjoyed the introductory lecture to this course, and it will surely provide practical and in-demand skills for future internships and jobs.  It is still early in the program, but the topics I am most interested in so far are text analytics, machine learning, and NLP for ICALL.
f	Human interaction can have many different forms. The usage of natural language is only one of them, although to me it seems to be the most sophisticated way. A main advantage of humans compared to apes is their ability to communicate efficiently. Intrestingly, there are several thousand different languages which have evolved that serve that same purpose. Understanding how language works opens new perspectives.
f	"My interest in linguistics developed during my studies of German linguistics. I find it interesting how linguistic systems define our understanding of the world and how this had changed over time. 
It's pretty interesting how words and morphemes have changed. But to seek these changes with the hand and the eyes is difficult. Therefore, it is easier to study these differences in a way that is more elegant than before. In addition, the development of programming languages ​​is interesting compared to existing languages."
f	There are many applications in linguistics and computation. The difficulty is to formalize natural language. For me, it's really interesting that we can do linguistic research by computer. We try to make computer understand natural language. And there are so many different approaches.
m	Linguistics is a journey, but it is not one taken on foot or by whatsoever means of physical locomotion may be your preference. No, linguistics is a journey of the mind, one where we wander the very thoroughfares of thought, taking in the spectacle of unbridled human cerebration. Yet just as an odyssey by land (though not, in the majority of cases, by sea) is conveyed with far greater haste aided by a stalwart steed, so does the practice of computation carry us with unparalleled haste upon our linguistic endeavors. Who among us can claim to know of a greater achievement than to take even the first hesitant steps along this path to understanding the human mind and perhaps even the underlying soul? For what is a captcha if not a test of god given soul? Only a fool would place some other wretched field of study above this most hallowed one.
m	I'm mostly interested in the computational side of things. Linguistics is a field where I can apply the computational aspects of the program the most. Learning about the different methods in SNLP should be something that I can apply to other fields in computation, too. Language in general is also something that interests me. Learning many different languages also gave new perspectives here.
m	"I was always interested in learning languages, but also in logical thinking 
and math. Computational Linguistics is the perfect program to combine both of those passions of mine. 
In the linguistic field I find it fascinating to learn how the brain processes language and how people learn a second language 
differently from how they learn their native language. 
I also really like the way that language is explained in a logical way. 
On the computational side, AI is a very important and interesting topic for the future and 
it has a lot to do with Computational linguistics, since we are the ones that teach the AI how to understand, 
process and speak a new language. 
There are many more other interesting subjects in the field so there is something new to learn and discover every day. 
I am convinced, that I chose the right subject with a promising future."
m	"There are two major aspects of linguistics I find the most interesting. 
The first aspect is how languages come into being and how the boundaries, in which parts of the world they are spoken, develop.
For example, how is it possible, that in some areas people in almost every village speak a different language (E.g. in New Ireland, Papua New Guinea)?
The other aspect is related to learning. In particular, the difference between learning a native and a foreign language. I think it is a great example for the importance of interaction with the environment
for learning. Studying how children learn languages also lead to implications about the development and structur of the human brain.
Modelling these developments and learning in general with computational models sounds very exciting to me and I would like to learn more about it."
m	"From a young age I've been a very motivated language learner, and have been enjoying all sorts of fun with words - solving anagrams, playing scrabble, writing rhymes...the list goes on. With that in mind, I figured sticking to something language-related would be an appropriate choice of study, and being more technically rather than artistically inclined I opted for linguistics over literature. I had some experience programming in high school as well, and thought it would be fun (and, of course, sensible in terms of career development) to keep going, so computational linguistics seemed like the perfect choice; as a friend put it, ""connecting the beautiful and the useful"".

A little over three semesters in and I am increasingly leaning towards the computational side of things. I am starting to develop a strong liking for mathematics which I had previously considered too mechanical, and now find it hugely exciting to attempt to find patterns and rules which can be combined to form complex systems. Language can definitely pass as a complex system, and whether we can reliably deconstruct it to its atomic components, whatever they may be, is as much of a philosophical as it is a practical question. The answer to this is most probably no, but the thought of never being able to decode it fully may make it all the more enticing. It is as if language were a hugely convoluted math problem, one that no-one will ever find the solution to, but where making sense of even the smallest unexplored sub-equation would feel like a seismic event to anyone involved."
f	"I'm interested in linguistics, or the science of languages, because I believe language is what makes human human. 
And now with the assistance of computers, we can analyze a large amount of data that human alone couldn't.
Moreover, the combination between linguistics and computation refines linguistics. Because when I study linguistics, regardless of phonology, syntax, or semantics, I often feel like linguists kind of made up the theories to fix with the data and their assumption about how lanagues work. And it makes me a bit skeptical.
But computers work on rules and rules only; so we would know which theories work and which not.
My interests at present are about sentence/text comprehension and production, and applications of CL into education, and a bit about psycholinguistics (i.e. how languages make us human)."
f	"To learn more about linguistics and to combine it with ""something different"" was my cause to study computational linguistics.
Soon I discovered, that ISCL is more than just a combination. Its a whole new thing.
I always loved structuring and organizing things like lists and notebooks and to build up my own table of contents. 
Computational linguistics perfectly fits this passion."
f	"There are multiple reasons why I am interested in linguistics and computation.
I believe that one of the most important aspects of human intelligence consists of their ability to understand and generate natural language.
Therefore automatic processing of natural language is crucial for progress in technology and artificial intelligence.
It is really fascinating that machines can understand and even generate natural language and even improve themselves automatically.
Also I am interested in algorithms and languages in general and I think that combining those topics makes much sense."
f	"Learning languages has always been a hobby of mine. Learning to speak and understand other languages gives me a sense of accomplishment and changed how I view the world. When I learned that some machines/programs can understand and use natural languages, I wanted to learn how that is even possible. That's why I choose to study Computational Linguistics. Out of the major fields of Linguistics, Semantics and Pragmatics interest me the most. Since I had a lot of fun learning the meaning of language and figuring out how its meaning may change in different context. Machine learning is what makes ""intelligent"" machines/programs possible. To understand how it works, I have to know the statistical models behind it."
m	"Since early age, I had an interest in languages, and also computers. ISCL allows me to combine these two.
By analyzing and simplifying languages, we can see the underlying structures, and compare different languages. 
Also, by using different programming languages (Java, Python, etc.), we can translate machine language into real-world language, and vice versa.
To me, this field is very interesting, since it's always developing, and has a large variety of uses in the future."
m	"I am a master student of Computer science. I am interested in this course as it makes a connection between machine learning and my specialization. I am also motivated to get deeper in NLP problem due to participate  in neural network. Definitely,  it helps me to resolve NLP. 
Besides its beneficial, I am so curious in this topic!"
f	"Linguistics is an interesting field because languages are everywhere and one of the most integral aspects of humans and culture. 
Languages are used to communicate needs, wishes, experiences but are also exploited to manipulate. Let's develop computational methods to unveil Trump's
hidden agenda - well, we might not need a very complicated algorithm to do that - and detect and analyse politican's rhetorical skills.
But on a more serious, or rather more important note, it is fascinating to watch the development of programmes and algorithms, for instance in Machine Translation, in the recent years and deal with this fast developing subject. For instance, with the help of NLP, we can translate ever slightly more complex texts into another langauge, depending on the language pair with different qualities, 
and extract the content of a page without a human to have a single glance at it. NLP automates processes, and in the time of digitalisation and big data, NLP can be used for good purposes (also bad ones of course). 
And sometimes, dealing with languages from a computational point of view, we might also find underlying patterns or phenomena at work in languages we wouldn't have found otherwise."
